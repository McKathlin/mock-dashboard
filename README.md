# Mock Dashboard

This sample dashboard was made as part of The Odin Project curriculum.
It demonstrates mastery of CSS grid layouts and the ability to recreate a page design from an image.

This page layout is responsive enough to be viewable on a smartphone,
but the larger screen of a tablet or destkop computer provides a better viewing experience.

The mock dashboard is live here:

As this dashboard is only a layout demo, most of the links are not functional.
